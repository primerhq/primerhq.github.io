## Concept

An LLM provider is a named connection from primer to a chat or completion backend. Every agent and chat turn in primer routes through exactly one provider row; the row tells primer which API to call, how to authenticate, which model identifiers are allowed, and how many concurrent requests are permitted at once.

Primer uses a provider-pattern: adapters for each backend implement a shared streaming interface, and the agent loop only ever talks to that interface. The agent never depends on which backend is behind it (each vendor SDK lives inside its adapter plugin), so swapping or editing a provider changes the adapter, not the agent. A provider row is just configuration (one entry in the registry), and the adapter is built from it lazily when a first turn arrives. Editing a row rebuilds the adapter without restarting the server.

Six LLM provider types ship today:

- **anthropic**: Anthropic's Messages API (Claude family).
- **openresponses**: the OpenAI Responses API (`/v1/responses`). Targets the stateful, multi-turn Responses surface rather than the legacy Chat Completions endpoint.
- **openchat**: the legacy OpenAI Chat Completions API (`/v1/chat/completions`). Use this for OpenAI itself, LM Studio, vLLM, and other OpenAI-compatible servers.
- **gemini**: Google Gemini via the Gemini API (Google AI Studio). Uses a single API key; Vertex AI is a separate provider type if needed.
- **ollama**: a local or remote Ollama HTTP server. No API key required by default.
- **openrouter**: OpenRouter, a gateway in front of many upstream providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Mistral, and others). Exposes an OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` endpoint with a single key.

## Configuration

Every LLM provider row has these fields:

### Provider type

Selects the backend adapter. Choose from `anthropic`, `openresponses`, `openchat`, `gemini`, `ollama`, or `openrouter`. This determines which connection fields appear below.

### Provider ID

A unique handle you choose, for example `anthropic-prod` or `openrouter-free`. Agents and chats reference this ID when selecting a provider.

### Connection fields (per type)

**anthropic**
- `api_key`: your Anthropic API key. Optional at the schema level (leave unset when a proxy injects auth), but required for direct access to `api.anthropic.com`.

**openresponses**
- `url`: base URL of the OpenAI-compatible Responses API endpoint (e.g. `https://api.openai.com`).
- `api_key`: bearer token. Optional for unauthenticated endpoints like a self-hosted proxy.
- `flavor`: server variant: `openai` (real OpenAI), `lmstudio` (LM Studio quirk handling), or `other` (conservative defaults). Defaults to `other`.

**openchat**
- `url`: base URL of the Chat Completions endpoint.
- `api_key`: bearer token. Optional for unauthenticated endpoints.
- `flavor`: server variant: `openai`, `lmstudio`, `ollama`, `vllm`, or `other`. Defaults to `other`.

**gemini**
- `api_key`: Gemini API key from Google AI Studio. Optional when fronted by a proxy that supplies auth.

**ollama**
- `url`: base URL of the Ollama server (e.g. `http://localhost:11434`).
- `api_key`: optional bearer token. Only needed when running Ollama behind a reverse proxy with its own auth.

**openrouter**
- `api_key`: OpenRouter API key. Required (OpenRouter is always remote and always authenticated).
- `app_name`: optional. Sent as the `X-Title` header for attribution on the OpenRouter leaderboard.
- `app_url`: optional. Sent as the `HTTP-Referer` header for attribution.

### Models

A list of model identifiers the provider is allowed to serve. Each entry has:

- `name`: the provider-side model slug (e.g. `claude-opus-4-5`, `gpt-4o-mini`, `meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free`). Agents that request a model not in this list receive a `ModelNotFoundError`.
- `context_length`: the model's usable context window, in tokens. Primer uses this to drive automatic compaction: when a conversation's live history approaches this budget (around 90 percent), primer summarizes the older turns to stay within the window. Set it to the model's real context length so compaction fires at the right point; if it is too low, history is compacted too early, and if it is too high, a turn can overflow the model's actual limit.

Use **Discover models** to populate this list automatically from the upstream catalogue. Live discovery is supported for `anthropic`, `openresponses`, `gemini`, `ollama`, and `openrouter`; `openchat` has no list-models probe, so the console falls back to a curated suggested-model list there. Discovery fills in the model names; set a valid `context_length` for each model you keep (see above).

### Limits

- `max_concurrency`: maximum number of in-flight requests primer will send to this provider at once. When the cap is reached, additional requests queue until a slot opens. Set this to match your API tier's rate limits; a value that is too high causes upstream 429s, while a value that is too low wastes throughput. There is no default; you must choose a value.
- `request_timeout_seconds`: per-event inactivity timeout for streaming calls (default: `300`). If no token arrives within this window the stream is aborted with a timeout error and the concurrency slot is released cleanly. This is a stall timeout; a response that is actively producing tokens will not be cut off. Set to a lower value (e.g. `60`) for faster failure detection on small models or fast hardware. Set to `null` to disable the timeout entirely.

## Walkthrough

The following steps add an OpenRouter provider as an example. Steps are the same for all types; only the connection fields differ.

1. Go to **Providers** in the left navigation and open the **LLM** tab.
2. Click **Add provider**.
3. Set **Provider type** to `openrouter`.
4. Enter a provider ID such as `openrouter-free`.
5. Paste your OpenRouter API key into the `api_key` field. The base URL is hard-coded and pre-filled.
6. Optionally fill in `app_name` so your usage shows up on the OpenRouter leaderboard.
7. Click **Discover models** to fetch the current catalogue. Choose one or more models from the list (for a free tier, look for the `:free` suffix, such as `meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free`), and set a valid `context_length` for each one. For `meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct`, use `131072` (its 128K window).
8. Set `max_concurrency` to match your plan; `5` is a safe starting point for a free key.
9. Leave `request_timeout_seconds` at the default `300` unless you have a reason to change it.
10. Click **Save**.

```callout:note
For Anthropic, Discover models fetches the live catalogue from Anthropic's list-models endpoint. The endpoint does not return a per-model `context_length`, so each discovered model is seeded with a default you should set to the model's real context window (e.g. `200000` for the Claude 4 family).
